Game Instructions : How to Play

Game starts by showing a text message on the led matrix screen. Push the navigation switch down to start the game.

Game starts with a single bulb-body segment and grows after eating food that is randomly placed.
Game ends when snake hits its own body. If the snake head reaches the wall, the head will appear from the opposite wall.

Compile Instructions

Since the game uses dependecies in "ence260-ucfk4" folder, the game needs to be 
cloned in the same folder. In order to do this, first need to open the folder's
terminal and write "git clone https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/ence260-2021/group_440.git".
This would create a folder named "group_440", and then locate to "group_440/final" path.
Finally, open this folder's terminal and write "make program" to run the game.
